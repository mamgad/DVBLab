# Module 0: Secure Code Review Methodology

## 1. Introduction to Secure Code Review

### 1.1 What is Secure Code Review?
Secure code review is a systematic examination of source code to identify security vulnerabilities that could compromise an application's integrity. In the context of our banking application, this process is particularly crucial as we're dealing with sensitive financial data and transactions. During a review, security professionals analyze the codebase to identify potential vulnerabilities in authentication mechanisms, transaction processing, data validation, and other security-critical components. This proactive approach helps prevent security breaches before they can be exploited in production environments.

### 1.2 Types of Code Review Approaches
Code review can be approached through different methodologies, each offering unique insights into application security:

Manual Code Review involves line-by-line examination of the source code, focusing on security-critical components like authentication modules, transaction processors, and data access layers. In our banking application, this includes reviewing password hashing implementations, session management code, and transaction validation logic.

Automated Analysis utilizes specialized tools to identify common security patterns and potential vulnerabilities. This includes static application security testing (SAST) tools that can identify issues like SQL injection vulnerabilities in database queries, cross-site scripting (XSS) in frontend React components, and insecure cryptographic implementations.

Hybrid Review combines both manual and automated approaches. For instance, automated tools might flag potential SQL injection points in our banking application's transaction processing code, which reviewers then manually verify and assess for exploitability.

## 2. Code Review Methodology

### 2.1 Pre-Review Phase
The pre-review phase establishes the foundation for effective code analysis. It begins with understanding the banking application's architecture, including its React frontend, Python backend, and database schema. Security requirements specific to financial applications are reviewed, including regulatory requirements for handling customer data and transaction processing.

Scope definition focuses on identifying security-critical components. In our banking application, this includes user authentication modules, transaction processing systems, account management functions, and data access layers. Special attention is paid to components handling sensitive operations like fund transfers and account balance updates.

Risk assessment prioritizes code review efforts based on potential impact. High-risk components like payment processing modules and user authentication systems receive thorough scrutiny, while lower-risk components like UI formatting functions might receive lighter review.

### 2.2 Review Phase
During the review phase, code is examined through multiple security lenses. Architecture review evaluates the implementation of security patterns and controls. For our banking application, this includes examining how authentication is implemented across the full stack, how session management is handled, and how transaction integrity is maintained.

Security control review focuses on specific security mechanisms. This includes analyzing input validation in both frontend and backend code, examining SQL query construction for injection vulnerabilities, and reviewing access control implementations. Special attention is paid to transaction validation logic and account access controls.

Vulnerability assessment identifies specific weaknesses in the code. This includes reviewing for common banking application vulnerabilities like:
- Transaction tampering through parameter manipulation
- Authentication bypass through session management flaws
- Unauthorized account access through IDOR vulnerabilities
- SQL injection in financial queries
- Cross-site scripting in transaction history displays

### 2.3 Exploitation and Verification
The exploitation phase verifies identified vulnerabilities through practical testing. This involves:

Proof of Concept Development: Creating specific test cases that demonstrate vulnerability exploitation. For example, crafting SQL injection payloads that could manipulate transaction records or developing scripts that exploit authentication bypasses.

Impact Assessment: Evaluating the real-world implications of each vulnerability. In our banking context, this might include demonstrating how an attacker could:
- Transfer funds from other users' accounts
- Elevate privileges to administrative access
- View sensitive customer information
- Manipulate transaction histories
- Bypass transaction limits

## 3. Security Control Assessment

- Session handling in session_manager.py

Pattern Recognition: Looking for common vulnerability patterns in our codebase:
- Unvalidated user input in API endpoints
- Direct object references in account access
- Insecure SQL queries in transaction processing
- Weak cryptographic implementations in authentication

## 9. Exploitation Techniques and Examples

### 9.1 Common Attack Vectors
Practical examples from our banking application:

SQL Injection:
```python
# Vulnerable code from transaction history
def get_transactions(user_id):
    query = f'SELECT * FROM "Transaction" WHERE sender_id = {user_id} OR receiver_id = {user_id}'
    result = db.session.execute(query)  # Vulnerable to SQL injection
    
# Secure implementation
def get_transactions(user_id):
    query = text('SELECT * FROM "Transaction" WHERE sender_id = :user_id OR receiver_id = :user_id')
    result = db.session.execute(query, {'user_id': user_id})
```

### Authentication Bypass
Here's an example of authentication bypass vulnerability and its fix:

```python
# Vulnerable Implementation from transaction routes
@app.route('/api/transfer', methods=['POST'])
def transfer():
    # Missing authentication check
    data = request.get_json()
    amount = Decimal(str(data.get('amount', 0)))
    to_user_id = data.get('to_user_id')
    
    # Direct balance manipulation without validation
    current_user.balance -= amount
    receiver.balance += amount
    db.session.commit()

# Secure Implementation
@transaction_bp.route('/api/transfer', methods=['POST'])
@token_required  # <-- Authentication: Verifies JWT token
def transfer(current_user):
    try:
        data = request.get_json()
        amount = validate_amount(data.get('amount'))
        to_user_id = data.get('to_user_id')
        
        with atomic_transaction():  # <-- Transaction atomicity
            receiver = User.query.get(to_user_id)
            if not receiver:
                raise ValidationError("Invalid recipient")
                
            if current_user.balance < amount:
                raise InsufficientFunds("Insufficient balance")
                
            current_user.balance -= amount
            receiver.balance += amount
            
        audit_log.info(f"Transfer: {current_user.id} -> {to_user_id}, amount: {amount}")
        return jsonify({'message': 'Transfer successful'})
        
    except ValidationError as e:
        return jsonify({'error': str(e)}), 400
```

Key Security Controls:
1. Authentication check (@require_auth)
2. Authorization validation (can_access_account)
3. Safe database queries (query.get_or_404)
4. Audit logging
5. Proper error handling

### 9.2 Proof of Concept Development
Methodology for creating PoCs in our banking environment:

1. Vulnerability Identification:
```python
# Example of identifying transaction validation vulnerability
@app.route('/api/transfer', methods=['POST'])
def transfer():
    data = request.get_json()
    amount = data.get('amount', 0)  # No type validation
    to_user_id = data.get('to_user_id')  # No existence check
    
    # Vulnerable: No proper validation or atomicity
    current_user.balance -= amount
    receiver.balance += amount
```

2. Exploit Development:
```python
# Example exploit script for transaction validation
def test_transaction_vulnerability():
    # Login as test user
    session = login('test_user', 'password123')
    
    # Attempt negative amount transfer
    response = session.post('/api/transfer', json={
        'to_user_id': 2,
        'amount': -1000  # Negative amount
    })
    
    # Attempt transfer with invalid precision
    response = session.post('/api/transfer', json={
        'to_user_id': 2,
        'amount': 100.999999  # Invalid decimal precision
    })
```

3. Impact Demonstration:
```python
# Example of demonstrating race condition in transfers
def demonstrate_race_condition():
    # Create test accounts
    sender = create_test_account(1000)  # $1000 balance
    receiver = create_test_account(0)   # $0 balance
    
    # Execute concurrent transfers
    def concurrent_transfer():
        transfer_amount(
            from_account=sender.id,
            to_account=receiver.id,
            amount=1000
        )
    
    # Start multiple transfers simultaneously
    threads = [Thread(target=concurrent_transfer) for _ in range(3)]
    for t in threads:
        t.start()
    for t in threads:
        t.join()
        
    # Check final balances
    print(f"Sender balance: {get_balance(sender.id)}")
    print(f"Receiver balance: {get_balance(receiver.id)}")
```

## 10. Real-world Application

### 10.1 Code Review Checklist
Specific checklist for our banking application:

Frontend (React):
- [ ] Check for exposed sensitive data in state management
- [ ] Verify CSRF protection on all forms
- [ ] Review authentication state management
- [ ] Validate input sanitization
- [ ] Check for secure communication with backend

Backend (Python):
- [ ] Review all database queries for SQL injection
- [ ] Verify transaction atomicity
- [ ] Check authentication mechanisms
- [ ] Validate access control implementation
- [ ] Review error handling and logging

### 10.2 Common Findings and Solutions
Practical examples from our codebase:

1. Transaction Race Conditions:
```python
# Problem: Unsynchronized balance updates in transfer route
def transfer_funds(current_user, to_user_id, amount):
    if current_user.balance >= amount:  # Race condition
        current_user.balance -= amount
        receiver.balance += amount
        db.session.commit()

# Solution: Implement proper transaction handling
@atomic_transaction()
def transfer_funds(current_user, to_user_id, amount):
    # Lock accounts for update
    sender = User.query.with_for_update().get(current_user.id)
    receiver = User.query.with_for_update().get(to_user_id)
    
    if sender.balance >= amount:
        sender.balance -= amount
        receiver.balance += amount
```

2. Insecure Direct Object References:
```python
# Problem: No authorization in transaction history
@app.route('/api/transactions/<transaction_id>')
def get_transaction(transaction_id):
    # Direct object reference vulnerability
    transaction = Transaction.query.get(transaction_id)
    return jsonify(transaction.to_dict())

# Solution: Add proper authorization
@app.route('/api/transactions/<transaction_id>')
@token_required
def get_transaction(current_user, transaction_id):
    transaction = Transaction.query.get(transaction_id)
    if not transaction or (transaction.sender_id != current_user.id and 
                          transaction.receiver_id != current_user.id):
        raise Unauthorized("Access denied")
    return jsonify(transaction.to_dict())
```

This practical approach to code review and exploitation helps developers understand not just the theory but also the practical implementation of security in our banking application context.
