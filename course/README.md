   - Examples from our application
   - Prevention techniques

2. Authentication & Authorization
   - JWT implementation issues
   - Session management
   - Access control problems

3. Input Validation & Sanitization
   - Transaction amount validation
   - User input handling
   - Data type conversion issues

4. API Security
   - CORS configuration
   - Rate limiting
   - Error handling

5. Secure Coding Practices
   - Secure password handling
   - Proper logging
   - Transaction safety
